theorem "suppose":
    a -> (a -> b) -> b
proof
    suppose h1: a
    suppose h2: a -> b
    thus b by h1, h2
end 

theorem "not intro":
    ~b & (a -> b) -> ~a
proof
    suppose h: ~b & (a -> b)
    suppose a: a
    hence false by h, a
end

theorem trueI: true
proof
    thus true
end

theorem falseE: false -> a
proof
    thus false -> a
end
