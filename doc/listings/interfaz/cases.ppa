theorem "cases":
    (a & b) | (c & a) -> a
proof
    suppose h: (a & b) | (c & a)
    cases by h
        case a & b
            hence a
        case right: a & c
            thus a by right
    end
end

theorem "cases prop":
    ~((~a | ~b) & (~c | ~a)) -> a
proof
    suppose h: ~((~a | ~b) & (~c | ~a))
    cases by h
        case a & b
            hence a
        case right: a & c
            thus a by right
    end
