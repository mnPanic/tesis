axiom ax1: a -> b
axiom ax2: b -> c

theorem t1: a -> c
proof
    suppose a: a
    have b: b by a, ax1
    thus c by b, ax2
end

theorem t1': a -> c
proof
    suppose a: a
    have b: b by -, ax1
    thus c by -, ax2
end

theorem t1'': a -> c
proof
    suppose -: a
    then -: b by ax1
    hence c by ax2
end
